## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **File Processing Logic:**
```python
# Process each uploaded file
for file in files:
    if isinstance(file, str):
        # This is a file path from Gradio
        filename = Path(file).name
        with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
            content = f.read()
        all_content.append(content)
        all_filenames.append(filename)

# Combine content for analysis
combined_content = "\n\n--- DOCUMENT SEPARATOR ---\n\n".join(all_content)
```

### **Clear Button Handler:**
```python
clear_btn.click(
    fn=lambda: (None, "", "", "", "", ""),
    outputs=[file_input, status_output, compliance_matrix_output, 
             analytics_output, comparison_output, recommendations_output]
